**Now compatible with Nuke 16.0 (Nuke 13.0 and above)**

## Stamps for Nuke with alternative GUI


Here is a quick summary of the changes made to the original code:

- new GUI to set up new Node Connections
- search and create like Nuke Nodes (Character-based matching, hit Tab/Enter to create)
- Support for colored Anchors and Backdrops
- disable/hide Anchors (e.g. you import another nukescript as reference)
- **CTRL+SHIFT+Drop Node** to swap nodes preserves connections
- performance improvements

### new Shortcuts

- **RIGHT CLICK** to preview with Viewer (resets Viewer on close)
- **SHIFT+CLICK:** select and create multiple Stamps
- **ALT+CLICK:** open color quick menu to colorize Anchor

### Known issues

To properly support colored Anchors and Stamps (red font for broken connections, nicer formatting), we had to utilize HTML for the autolabel. Unfortunately, Nuke behaves a bit funky with those. If you zoom in/out in the DAG, you'll notice that the last character sometimes flips into a new line. We haven't found a way to work around this, I opened a bug report, let's hope for the best :) -> [Bug Report (Foundry Account required)](https://support.foundry.com/hc/en-us/articles/18657215784978-ID-575964-The-formatting-on-a-nodes-autolabel-breaks-at-certain-zoom-levels-in-the-Node-Graph)
